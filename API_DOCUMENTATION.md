## Best Practices

1. **Rate Limiting**: Implement rate limiting on your client side to avoid overwhelming the API
2. **Error Handling**: Always handle potential API errors gracefully
3. **Caching**: Cache frequently accessed data like questions to reduce API calls
4. **Monitoring**: Monitor API usage and response times
5. **Security**: Store API keys securely and rotate them regularly
